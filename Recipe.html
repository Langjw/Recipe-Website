<h3>The Bomb Breakfast Burrito</h3>
<img src="breakfast1.jpeg">
<h5>Ingredients</h5>
<h4>Smoky Black Beans:</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
    <li>1 small onion, finely diced</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 cans black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon pureed chipotle chile in adobo
Kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro</li>
</ul>
<h4>Chorizo Filling:</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
    <li>1/2 pound loose Mexican chorizo or breakfast sausage</li>
    <li>1 small red onion, halved and thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 yellow bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>12 large eggs, whisked until very smooth and fluffy</li>
    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
</ul>
<h4>To Assemble:</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Canola oil, for brushing</li>
    <li>Eight 10-inch flour tortillas</li>
    <li>2 cups grated Monterey Jack</li>
</ul>
<h5>Directions</h5>
<h4>For the black beans: </h4>
<p>Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 30 seconds. Add the beans, 1/2 cup water, and the chipotle and cook, stirring occasionally, until the water is reduced and beans are heated through and soft, about 20 minutes. Use a potato masher to mash the beans into a chunky paste. Taste, and season with salt as necessary. Stir in the cilantro, and then spread on a baking sheet to cool. </p>
<h4>For the salsa: </h4>
<p>Put the avocados, tomatoes, green onions, serrano and some salt and pepper in a large bowl and fold together. Fold in the lime juice, oil, cilantro and watercress. Set aside.</p>
<h4>For the chorizo filling:</h4>
<p>Heat the oil in a large skillet until it begins to shimmer. Add the chorizo and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 8 minutes, stirring a few times. With a slotted spoon, remove the sausage to a paper-towel-lined plate.
Add the onions and peppers to the pan drippings and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 8 minutes. If the chorizo is in large chunks, chop it coarsely, then stir it into the onions and peppers. Add the eggs, and scramble until soft curds form. Season with salt and pepper, then stir in the cilantro and remove from the heat.</p>
<h4>To assemble:</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Brush a nonstick baking sheet with some oil. Spread a thin layer of the beans across the center of a tortilla, leaving a 1-inch border. Top with some of the chorizo filling and a handful of Monterey Jack. Fold in the sides of the tortilla, and then roll from the bottom into a tight cylinder. Place seam-side down on the baking sheet and repeat with remaining tortillas, beans, filling and cheese. Brush the tops and sides of the burritos with canola oil, and bake until golden brown and crispy, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a platter and serve.</p>

<h3>Croquembouche</h3>
<h5>Ingredients</h5>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>2 cups water</li>
    <li>16 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>
    <li>2 cups flour</li>
    <li>8 to 10 eggs</li>
    <li>Filling, recipe follows</li>
</ul>
<h4>Filling</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>4 cups whole, 2 percent fat, or 1 percent fat milk</li>
    <li>1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise</li>
    <li>12 egg yolks</li>
    <li>1 1/3 cups granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
</ul>
<h4>Caramel</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>2 1/2 cups sugar</li>
    <li>2/3 cup water</li>
</ul>
<h5>Directions</h5>
<p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. In a large saucepan, bring the water, butter, salt, and sugar to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. When it boils, immediately take the pan off the heat. Stirring with a wooden spoon, add all the flour at once and stir hard until all the flour is incorporated, 30 to 60 seconds. Return the pan to the heat and cook, stirring, 30 seconds to evaporate some of the moisture.Scrape the mixture into a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or use a hand mixer). Mix at medium speed. With the mixer running, and working 1 egg at a time, add 6 of the eggs, stopping after each addition to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix until the dough is smooth and glossy and the eggs are completely incorporated. The dough should be thick, but should fall slowly and steadily from the beaters when you lift them out of the bowl. If the dough is still clinging to the beaters, add 1 or 2 more eggs, and mix until incorporated.Using a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip, pipe the dough in big kisses onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Whisk 2 eggs with 3 teaspoons of water. Brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash to knock down the points (do not use all the egg wash.) Bake 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375-degrees and bake until puffed up and light golden brown, about 20 minutes more. Try not to open the oven door too often during the baking. Let cool on the baking sheet. The recipe can be made up to this point and frozen in plastic bags. Filling: In a medium saucepan, heat the milk and vanilla bean to a boil over medium heat. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for 10 to 15 minutes. In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the cornstarch and whisk vigorously until no lumps remain. Whisk in 1/4 cup of the hot milk mixture until incorporated. Whisk in the remaining hot milk mixture, reserving the empty saucepan.Pour the mixture through a strainer back into the saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until thickened and slowly boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and any flavorings if you want to make a different flavor like chocolate or coffee. Let cool slightly. Cover with plastic wrap, lightly pressing the plastic against the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Chill at least 2 hours or until ready to serve. The custard can be made up to 24 hours in advance. Poke a hole with a plain pastry tip in the bottom of each cream puff and pipe it full of the custard.Caramel: Dissolve the sugar in a saucepan with the water, making an "X" through the sugar with your finger to allow the water to slowly soak into the sugar. Boil to make a light golden caramel then dip the bottom of the pan in an ice bath to stop the cooking. Dip the sides of the puffs in the caramel and stick them together (approximately 20 cream puffs) in a circle, tops facing out. Make a second row on top of the first but a bit smaller to draw the circle in and create a tower of cream puffs. Check it from all sides occasionally to make sure it's straight. When it's finished, drizzle it with caramel all over. You can also stick on decorative elements with the caramel in the crevices, like candied violets, gold balls, gum paste flowers, sugar covered almonds, etc.</p>
